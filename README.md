# DeveloperPad

This is a short introduction of using different stuff to handle Visual Studio. The DeveloperPad is a mechanical number keyboard where i remap some keys to another shortcuts to handle Visual Studio.

I use the a [Rottay](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B08T98CSRY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) mechanical keyboard, the [Microsoft Segoe MDL2 font](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/typography/font-list/segoe-mdl2-assets) and the very old [HIDMacros](http://hidmacros.eu/) to remap the keys to shortcuts. 

HIDMacros is very old but works if the compatibility mode and the admin mode activats. This small tool allows to remap keys from different devices which is  agreat way becaus windows inteprets multiple keyboards as one. The font is very clean to distinguish the keys and the mechanical keyboard has a good press point.
